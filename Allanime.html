							<h1>10 Anime Recommendations</h1>
							<p style="font-size:100%;"> Here at AnimeChads4u, we will be providing our favourable anime selections that we also enjoyed!</p>
							<br>
							<h2> 10. My Hero Academia </h2>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/myhero.png" alt="" /></span>
							<p> <br> Sypnosis: </br>The appearance of "quirks," newly discovered super powers, has been steadily increasing over the years, with 80 percent of humanity possessing various abilities from manipulation of elements to shapeshifting. This leaves the remainder of the world completely powerless, and Izuku Midoriya is one such individual.</p>
							<p>Since he was a child, the ambitious middle schooler has wanted nothing more than to be a hero. Izuku's unfair fate leaves him admiring heroes and taking notes on them whenever he can. But it seems that his persistence has borne some fruit: Izuku meets the number one hero and his personal idol, All Might. All Might's quirk is a unique ability that can be inherited, and he has chosen Izuku to be his successor!</p>
							<p>Enduring many months of grueling training, Izuku enrolls in UA High, a prestigious high school famous for its excellent hero training program, and this year's freshmen look especially promising. With his bizarre but talented classmates and the looming threat of a villainous organization, Izuku will soon learn what it really means to be a hero.</p>
							<p> <b> Danny's Thoughts: </b> My Hero Academia is one of the best animes I watched in my life, the whole plot of the anime focusing around superpowers intrigues me a lot. The main character is an amazing protagonist as he plays the role of being the weak bullied kid and becoming one of the greatest heroes alive. </p>
							<p> <b> Rating: </b> 9/10 </p>
							<br>
							<h2> 9. LinkClicked </h2>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/linkclick.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p> It is said that a picture is worth a thousand words. In this case, it holds an infinite amount of secrets. These are secrets that only Cheng Xiaoshi and Lu Guang are able to find. In a small shop called "Time Photo Studio," the two friends provide a special service: using their extraordinary powers that let them enter photographs, they jump into pictures brought to them by clients in order to grant their wishes. Through the eyes of the photographer, they live through the events surrounding the picture and try to decipher how to solve their client's request. </p>
							<p> But every time they jump into a picture, they take a great risk. One wrong move and they could alter the future of the person who took the picture... and possibly countless other events too. So when the events they are forced to live through in these pictures start to become personal, it will take the utmost strength to push their feelings aside and focus on accomplishing the task they were paid to do. </p>
							<p> <b> Danny's Thoughts: </b> This anime is one of the best sci fi time travel shows I've watched, it is a chinese anime which at first I was scepticle about watching but I was so wrong, this is a Don't judge book by its cover anime. </p>
							<p> <b>	Rating: </b> 10/10  </p>
							<br>
							<h2> 8. Haikyuu </h2>
							<p> Hinata Shoyo’s love for volleyball began when he saw a national championship match on TV. Since then, he has dreamed of becoming a great volleyball player despite his small figure. To achieve this, he joins Karasuno High’s volleyball team and with them, they devote themselves to making it to nationals. The story follows both Hinata and his team as they overcome challenges and grow their passion for volleyball.</p>
							<p> <b> Jasmine's Thoughts: </b> This is definitely an anime you should check out if you are interested in sports, especially volleyball! What I really love about Haikyuu is how you can’t dislike any of the characters and you become invested in each character’s back story. It is a really great one to watch if you prefer something more lighthearted (or not so serious) and you really get to follow the characters through their highs and their lows while trying to pursue their volleyball dreams!</p>
